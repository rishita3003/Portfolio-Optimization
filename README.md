# Portfolio-Optimization
## Overview
This project focuses on the risk assessment and optimization of stock portfolios using historical data. The primary goal is to maximize the Sharpe ratio, which indicates the best possible return-to-risk scenario for a given portfolio.

## Features
- **Risk Assessment**: Analyze stocks based on their historical volatility and returns.
- **Sharpe Ratio Calculation**: Compute the Sharpe ratio to identify the most efficient portfolio.
- **Visualization**: Plot risk-return profiles to visually assess potential investment choices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Library**
   - _**Pandas**_ for data manipulation
   - _**NumPy**_ for numerical calculations
   - _**Matplotlib**_ and Seaborn for data visualization
   - _**Yahoo Finance**_ for fetching historical stock data

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishita3003/Portfolio-Optimization.git
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:

   jupyter notebook "portfolio optimization.ipynb"
   ```


## Notebook Summary


## Results
- Visualizations of the efficient frontier demonstrate the trade-off between risk and return.
- The optimal portfolio configuration and its expected annual return and risk metrics are presented.
## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to apply quantitative techniques to optimize stock portfolios, maximizing returns while controlling for risk.
